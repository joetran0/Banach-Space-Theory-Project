                <h3>Part 1: Reading on Schauder Bases and Finite-Dimensional Spaces</h3>

                <p>The first part of the project involves me reading and trying to understand some of the preliminary material on Schauder bases. The main reference used is <i>Banach Space Theory</i>, by Marián Fabian, Petr Habala, Petr Hájek, Vicente Montesinos, Václav Zizler. Here is a brief timeline and summary of what I have done so far.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(Dec. 23, 2024) Finished reading Section 4.1 on projections, complements, and topological complements. Used methods for proving including the open mapping theorem, the closed graph theorem, and the Hahn-Banach theorem. Introduced the notion of Auerbach bases, which are biorthogonal systems of \(X \times X^*\). Started on Section 4.2 on Schauder bases, in which, if we have an infinite dimensional Banach space, and we have a infinite sequence of vectors, then we can approximate a vector in \(X\) by an infinite linear combination of the sequence of vectors. This sequence of vectors is called a Schauder basis.</li>
            <li>(Dec. 27, 2024) Finished reading Section 4.2 on Schauder bases. Introduced some newer concepts about it including coordinate functionals, uniform boundedness of projections, and mentioned about the relation between Hamel bases and Schauder bases for coordinate functionals. Provided some examples of Schauder bases, including finite-dimensional normed spaces, orthonormal bases, and unit vector bases for \(c_0(\mathbb{N})\) and \(\ell_p(\mathbb{N})\). Started reading on Section 4.3 about shrinking and boundedly completeness. shrinking means that \(X^* = \overline{\langle{\{f_n\}_{n = 1}^{\infty}}\rangle}\), while boundedly complete means that any element in \(X\) converges whenever the supremum of finite sum is finite. Investigated some examples of shrinking and boundedly completeness. Spent time understanding the example for \(\ell_p\) space and wondered why the Schauder basis for \(\ell_p\) (also the unit vector basis) is shrinking for \(1 < p < \infty\), and boundedly complete for \(1 \leq p < \infty\).</li>
            <li>(Dec. 30, 2024) Finished reading Section 4.3, and started to read Section 4.4 on Block bases, and the Bessaga-Pełczyński Selection Principle. Defined what it means to have a basic sequence to be a block basic sequence, and went through some important theorems.</li>
            <li>(Jan. 6, 2025) Continued with Section 4.4 and started to be critical of the theorems that were mentioned in the book. Had a little bit of trouble understanding the proof of Theorem 4.28, but then after I had a look at some of the consequences of Theorem 4.28, which involves separability and infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. I also did a couple of exercises from this chapter for the previous sections, to get myself to understand the concepts. I think I will continue with Section 4.4, when we start talking about Finite-Dimensional Decompositions.</li>
            <li>(Jan. 8, 2025) Finished reading Section 4.4, including the small part about Finite Dimensional Decompositions of a Banach space \(X\).</li>
            <li>(Jan. 10, 2025) Started reading Section 4.5 on unconditional bases. We note that a series \(\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} x_n\) is unconditionally convergent, if \(\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \varepsilon_n x_n\) converges for all choices of signs $\varepsilon_n = \pm 1$. If \(\{e_n\}_{n = 1}^{\infty}\) is a Schauder basis of a Banach space \(X\), then \(\{e_n\}_{n = 1}^{\infty}\) is called unconditional if for every \(x \in X\), its expansion \(x = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \lambda_n e_n\) is unconditionally convergent. I also had a look at a couple of examples, including the unit vector basis for \(\ell_p(\mathbb{N})\), and a separable Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\) with an orthonormal basis \(\mathcal{O} = \{e_{\gamma}\}_{\gamma \in \Gamma}\). I stopped at Proposition 4.36, but proved that condition (iii) is true. (<a href="Unconditional Bases.pdf">See notes here</a>)</li>
            <li>(Jan. 14, 2025) Continued reading Section 4.5 on unconditional bases. Introduced some new notation including \(\mathfrak{ubc}\) which is called the unconditional basis constant. Two important properties that have been mentioned:
                <ol>
                    <li>Theorem 4.37, 4.39: Let \(X\) be a separable Banach space. If \(X\) has an unconditional Schauder basis that is either (i) not bounded complete or (ii) not shrinking, then \(X\) contains an isomorphic copy of \(c_0(\mathbb{N})\) or \(\ell_1(\mathbb{N})\), respectively.</li>
                </ol>
                Next time, I will try to finish up reading Section 4.5, and start looking at Section 4.6 on Bases in Classical Spaces, and maybe Section 4.7 on Subspaces of \(L_p\)-spaces.
            </li>
            <li>(Jan. 16, 2025) My supervisor has reached out regarding my progression of the book. So far, I have mentioned that I think there would be some questions that would be better to discuss in the meeting rather than having a long email to read about. In the meantime, I have made some section summaries of what was covered in each section up to this point. I will also try to finish up Section 4.5 by today and update the above notes.
